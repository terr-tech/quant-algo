# quant-algo-reference


This repository consists of different trading algorithms used on Quantopian.
It consists of both pipelines and actual algorithms.

Readme will be periodically updated as I explore more mathematical optimization methods.


The file titled: axitrader.py is a file containing the up-to-date algo-trading algorithm
i currently use on axitrader. The average return is around 5+/-2% over the past 4 months.

Once again, welcome!
